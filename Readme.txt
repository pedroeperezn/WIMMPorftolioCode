This is the complete code of the project "Where is my mind?", in which I participated at VFS during the summer of 2023. 

"Where is my Mind?" is a single player puzzle game in which you play as an amnesiac man who wakes up in a neglected asylum. Now, you need to scape by solving a series of puzzles
with the help of a Kalimba.

This project was developed during my 3rd Term at the Vancouver Film School. It was developed over the span of 2 months, made in Unity 2022.2.14f1
